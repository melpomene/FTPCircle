FTPCircle
==========

Simply a commandline FTP program that will perform a search on multiple FTP servers listed in the serverlist.txt file.

Or to quote [melpomene](http://blog.kejsarmakten.se/all/projects/2011/05/15/python-ftp-client.html):
> The idea is that it should support multiple servers allowing the user the search them all at once and automating the choice of server when a file is selected for download.
